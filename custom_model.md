# Custom model

## How to train your custom model

There are 2 options to train your own recognition model.

**1. Open-source approach**

For the open-source approach, you can use your own data or generate your own dataset. To generate your own data, we recommend using
[TextRecognitionDataGenerator](https://github.com/Belval/TextRecognitionDataGenerator). We provide an example of dataset [here](https://jaided.ai/easyocr/modelhub/).
After you have a dataset, you can train your own model by following this repository
[deep-text-recognition-benchmark](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark).
The network needs to be fully convolutional in order to predict flexible text length. Our current network is 'None-VGG-BiLSTM-CTC'.
Once you got your trained model (.pth file), you need 2 additional files describing recognition network architecture and model configuration.
The example is provided in `custom_example.zip` file [here](https://jaided.ai/easyocr/modelhub/).

Please do not create an issue about data generation and model training in this repository. If you have any question regarding data generation and model training, please ask in the respective repositories.

Note: We also provide our version of training script [here](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/tree/master/trainer). It is a modified version from [deep-text-recognition-benchmark](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark).

**2. Web-based approach**

Jaided AI provides a web-based (paid) service for training your own model [here](https://jaided.ai/). You can train your model on the cloud and export it for local deployment. All 3 files are downloadable once model is trained on cloud.

## How to use your custom model

To use your own recognition model, you need 3 files either from open-source approach or web-based approach. These three files have to share the same name (for example, yourmodel.pth, yourmodel.yaml, yourmodel.py) and you will call your model by this name in EasyOCR api.

We provide [custom_example.zip](https://jaided.ai/easyocr/modelhub/)
as an example. Please download, extract and place `custom_example.py`, `custom_example.yaml` in user_network_directory (default = `~/.EasyOCR/user_network`) and place `custom_example.pth` in model directory (default = `~/.EasyOCR/model`)
Once you place all 3 files in the right place. You can use `custom_example` by
specifying `recog_network` like this `reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'], recog_network = 'custom_example')`.
